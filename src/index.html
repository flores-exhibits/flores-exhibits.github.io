              In June 2019, a team of lawyers went to detention facilities at the U.S. / Mexico border, to monitor how living conditions there violated the <a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/FLORES_SETTLEMENT_AGREEMENT.pdf">Flores Settlement Agreement</a>. This January 17, 1997 agreement set limits on the length of time and conditions under which children can be held in immigration detention, which were upheld by the June 27, 2017 order in Flores v. Sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              This team of lawyers took sworn testimonies from <span class="bold-italic">children and young adults</span> - often young parents - detailing their experiences in detention facilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              These sworn testimonies were submitted as exhibits attached to a motion for a temporary restraining order filed by the National Center for Youth Law on June 26, 2019 which seeks to <span class="bold-italic">provide immediate relief</span> to children living without access to basic hygiene supplies and adequate nutrition or sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the videos below, each reader reads strictly what is presented in the sworn testimonies. This project is part of a national campaign to <span class="bold-italic">establish legal protections</span> for immigrants in facilities run by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

              This project is co-created by Waterwell and the Broadway Advocacy Coalition in collaboration with the Immigrants' Rights Clinic and the Center for Institutional and Social Change at Columbia Law School. By bringing two arts-based organizations with deep roots in civic engagement into a collaboration with the rigor, policy knowledge, and research prowess of two legal and public policy organizations, The Flores Exhibits aims to affect and influence systemic change through narrative-driven advocacy.
