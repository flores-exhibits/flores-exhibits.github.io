            This project is co-created by Waterwell and the Broadway Advocacy Coalition in collaboration with the Immigrants' Rights Clinic and the Center for Institutional and Social Change at Columbia Law School. By bringing two arts-based organizations with deep roots in civic engagement into a collaboration with the rigor, policy knowledge, and research prowess of two legal and public policy organizations, The Flores Exhibits aims to affect and influence systemic change through narrative-driven advocacy.
