        In the videos below, artists, lawyers, advocates, and immigrants read the <span class="bold-italic">sworn testimonies of children held in detention facilities</span> at the U.S. / Mexico Border.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is part of a national campaign to <span class="bold-italic">establish legal protections for immigrant children</span> held in U.S. government facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement sets a limit on the length of time a child can be detained, requires that they be held in the least restrictive area possible, and guarantees access to basic hygiene supplies, adequate nutrition, and appropriate clothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In June 2019, a team of lawyers who work as independent monitors of the detention facilities took <span class="bold-italic">more than 60 testimonies</span> from children detailing lengthy stays, ongoing family separations, and dirty, unsafe conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        These sworn testimonies were submitted as exhibits in a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order filed by the National Center for Youth Law. The motion seeks to <span class="bold-italic">provide immediate relief</span> to children living without access to basic hygiene supplies and adequate nutrition or sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        On September 27, Judge Dolly Gee of the 9th Circuit ruled against the Trump administration's proposal to end the Flores Settlement Agreement entirely, which would allow <span class="bold-italic">indefinite detention</span> and <span class="bold-italic">eliminate independent oversight</span>. The administration is likely to appeal this ruling, increasing the likelihood that this matter will be heard by the Supreme Court.
      </p>
      <p>
        The need to raise awareness, organize, and take action is urgent.
