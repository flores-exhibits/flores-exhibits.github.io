        The Flores Settlement Agreement (FSA), signed on January 17, 1997, established the rights of immigrant children held in U.S. Customs and Border Protection detention facilities. It set a limit on the length of time a child could be detained, requires that they be held in the least restrictive area possible, and guarantees access to basic hygiene supplies, adequate nutrition, and appropriate clothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In June 2019, a team of lawyers who work as independent monitors of the detention facilities took <span class="bold-italic">more than 60 testimonies</span> from children detailing lengthy stays, ongoing family separations and dirty, unsafe conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        These sworn testimonies were submitted as exhibits in a motion for a temporary restraining order filed by the National Center for Youth Law. The motion seeks to <span class="bold-italic">provide immediate relief</span> to children living without access to basic hygiene supplies and adequate nutrition or sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Trump administration recently announced a proposal to eliminate the Flores Settlement Agreement entirely, allowing <span class="bold-italic">indefinite detention</span> and <span class="bold-italic">eliminating independent oversight</span> of CBP facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The need to raise awareness, organize, and take action is urgent.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the videos below, each reader reads strictly what is presented in the sworn testimonies. This project is part of a national campaign to <span class="bold-italic">establish legal protections</span> for immigrants held in facilities run by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
