      <p>
        In June 2019, a team of lawyers went to detention facilities at the U.S. / Mexico border, and discovered the conditions there did not meet the requirements laid out in the Flores Settlement.</p>
      <p>
        This team of lawyers took <span class="emphasis">65 sworn testimonies</span> from children and young adults – often young parents – detailing their experience in the detention facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        These 65 sworn testimonies were submitted as exhibits attached to a motion for a temporary restraining order filed by the National Center for Youth Law on June 26, 2019 which seeks to <span class="emphasis">provide immediate relief</span> to children living without access to basic hygiene supplies and adequate nutrition or sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the videos below, each reader reads <span class="emphasis">strictly what is presented in the sworn testimonies.</span>
